# Simple Database Application of Website "Armut"

## Summary
In this project, we are developing a simple database application of "Armut" website 
using Phyton and SQLite.
#### Preperation Stage:
An Entity/Relationship diagram was constructured, and then it 
was translated into actual tables in SQLite by using SQLite Studio.
#### Main Stage:
In order to build a User Interface, the data was extracted from the created database by using possible SQL queries with Python (SQLite3 library).
Extracted data and built tables were connected together in a menu system 
using PySimpleGUI. For example, there are prepared screens that allow the user to manipulate 
(insert, update, and delete tuples) the data in our tables, as well as other screens that let the 
user execute some meaningful queries.
